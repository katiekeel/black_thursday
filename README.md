# Black Thursday

This was the final project of the first quarter at Turing. With a partner, we created business intelligence software *without* the use of a database, Rails, ActiveRecord, or anything other than pure Ruby.  

The project taught us about importing and sanitizing data, searching through and sorting collections, building relationships between classes and objects within classes, traversing those relationships and collecting objects/datapoints while traversing, and data analysis for business intelligence purposes.
